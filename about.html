        <p class="desc">OWNER & SHOPKEEPER:
            A mother of four and a professor at LSPU SPCC University who decided to make a coffee business.
            She started from a milktea business and soon incorporated coffees in her menu due to its popularity among students in the school.
            Her small business has since grown inside LSPU SPCC, and continues to grow more by selling a variety of products inside the University.
